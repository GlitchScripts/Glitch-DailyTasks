# Glitch-DailyTasks
This is Glitch's daily tasks script (and my very first foray into GitHub and KoLmafia)

It performs:
* Clip Art creations
* "breakfast"
* Simple dietary tasks
* Consult skillbook attempts

## License
TBD

## Installation
Run this command in the graphical CLI:
```
git checkout https://github.com/GlitchScripts/Glitch-DailyTasks main
```
Will require [a recent build of KoLMafia](http://builds.kolmafia.us/job/Kolmafia/lastSuccessfulBuild/).

## Usage
Just enter `_G-DAILYTASKS` into the gCLI.  It will do the rest.
